      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <p>Hey there! My name is Bianca Rossetti and I'm a <b>Computer Science student</b> at Dawson College. 
        Throughout my time there, I learned a wide array of different technologies, some of my favourites being <b>Full Stack Development and Programming</b> various apps and games! 
        Though I do work with computers a lot, in my free time, I also love to <b>read and meet with my friends</b>! 
        Some day, i hope <b>my work can have an impact</b> on at least one person for the better, because that would mean, 
        to me, that I am <b>fulfulling my duty as a Computer Scientist</b> to make people's lives easier through automation 
        and programmation! And someday, I hope my work manages to travel to space and back :)</p>
