      <h2>About me</h2> 
      <p>Hey there :) My name is Bianca Rossetti and I'm a Computer Science student at Dawson College. Throughout my time there, I learned a wide array of different technologies, soem of my favourites being Full Stack Development and Programming various apps and games! Though I do work with computers a lot, in my free time, I also love to read and meet with my friends! Some day, i hope my work can have an impact on at least one person for the better, because that would mean, to me, that I am fulfulling my duty as a Computer Scientist to make people's lives easier through automation and programmation! And someday, I hope my work manages to travel to space and back :)</p>
